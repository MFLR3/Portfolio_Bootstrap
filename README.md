# Notes for Nick
This is your standard Express server I assume.
Not meaning to tell you how to suck eggs but: 
- install npm and express
- run nodemon

Most pages are obviously placeholders. 

If you could give me some feedback on the folder structure, the index.js Server and anything else you feel is worth pointing out.

Thanks Nick, talk soon.
